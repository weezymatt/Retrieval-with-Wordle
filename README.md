# Retrieval with Wordle

This information retrieval (IR) project was created with the purpose of efficiently playing the web-based game Wordle (i.e., guess the word with the least number of tries). The core implementation makes use of a positional index of the World dictionary from scratch.

## Dependencies

## Workflow
> **Note** Intended only for project team.

Before you start editing any code, you will need to use your own development branch in the repository to hold your own work.
- Any time you want to add something to the code, please make a separate branch and create a pull request. This is so we can review and understand what everyone is contributing and be notified when we need to pull from main.
- Please do not directly push to main (**very important, we should not merge our own pull request, someone else will review and merge it!**)
- Run this inside the terminal inside the source folder src to play Wordle. 
  ```bash
  python3 main.py
  ```

**To set up the project environment, follow these steps:**

1. Cloning the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yamyeti/wordle.git
cd wordle
```
2. Setting up Virtual Environment
- Windows
  ```bash
  python -m venv <virtual-environment-name>
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- Linux and MacOS
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv <virtual-environment-name>
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
4. Keep a Running List of Dependencies

   *The virtual environment will make use of its own pip, so you don't need to use pip3.*
   ```bash
   pip install <dependencies>
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```
3. Install the Required Dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
