# Retrieval with Wordle

This information retrieval (IR) project was created with the purpose of efficiently playing the web-based game Wordle (i.e., guess the word with the least number of tries). The core implementation makes use of permuterm trees and k-gram indexes of the World dictionary with the open-source IR system Lucene.

## Dependencies

pip3 install collections typing matplotlib

## Workflow
> **Note** Intended only for project team.

Before you start editing any code, you will need to use your own development branch in the repository to hold your own work.
- Any time you want to add something to the code, please make a separate branch and create a pull request. This is so we can review and understand what everyone is contributing and be notified when we need to pull from main.
- Please do not directly push to main (**very important, we should not merge our own pull request, someone else will review and merge it!**)
- Run this inside the terminal inside the source folder src to play Wordle. 
  ```bash
  python3 main.py
  ```
